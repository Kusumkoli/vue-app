### Customize configuration(for more details on setup and compilation)

### Plugins Used
1. Babel
2. ESLint

### Problem Approach
```
The basic approach followed is to fetch data from randomtext.me/api multiple times and push the data object into an array so as to store an array of objects. And then display a preview of data which on-click opens a modal dialog box displaying all the data from API fetch along with a picture from 'picsum.photos'
```
### Brief
```
The most important part of the application lies in App.vue. The page is responsive.
